# Recipe Directory made with ReactJS

This serves as just a fun little portfolio project I followed through and learned from Net Ninja's course (will be mentioned in the acknowledgments.)

In this project, I learned how to extensively use ReactJS hooks such as useState, useEffect, useReducer, useContext, and other Javascript concepts.
